# buoyancy-calculator
Simple graphical calculator in Tkinter

Buoyancy Calculator calculates the buoyancy. No kidding.

The user can select a geometry (so far only sphere), a radius in meters and materials for the particle and the surrounding medium from a dropdown list.
The densities are saved in a list and are used to calculate the buoyant force when the Update button is pressed.

The program is made in Python and Tkinter for the graphical interface. The entry for the radius is validated to be a float. If other symbols are typed, it just ignores them and reverts back.
